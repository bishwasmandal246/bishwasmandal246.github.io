                &ensp;&ensp;Today I believe almost everyone of us is a philosopher one way or the other but philosophies remain just confine within words because we fail to embody our thoughts and reciprocate them in actions and this is when dissatisfaction arises; dissatisfaction&mdash; which creates problems, problems&mdash; that starts rooting from "I" to "Us" to "Ours" and gradually the whole population because "We"(Sapiens) may be departed by souls and religions but we all are entitled to one faith and that is humanity. Humanity and the innate curiosity (consciousness) helped our foraging ancestors to mushroom their thoughts and continue the struggle of existence until "I" (modern Sapiens) was born&mdash; but to my dismay the struggle still continues and it will for years.
                <img src="Images/conscious1.jpg" alt="Image- Girl watching from window">
                Well may be that is why whenever I walk down the streets I see girls, women and even boys holding placards with slogans" Rape Me!!!", "Save us, Save Sapiens", and when I see this I smile. I smile not because they hold the placards but for the major problem they are standing there for waiting to be addressed. And when I switch news channels in my TV, I see the manifesting terror of ISIS, the Taliban's and many more rebellious groups.<br><br>
                This is when I question myself, "Why?". And then I travel to different places from libraries to the gurus&mdash; who answer that humans have forgotten that the real focus lies between the point of rage and serenity. But I am not convinced so all I do is open my textbook and then I have my smile back again. Finally, I found my answer to my "Why?". The answer was just stuck in the roots of the education system waiting to be realized. My analysis says our education system is corrupt; it is myopic which ceases professions just to be occupations in the crude form aiming only to share the immediate fruits.<br><br>
               So problem doesn't lie in learning but in the education system which is parochial in its aim and fails students to acquaint with the knowledge that gives their imaginations a wings and thoughts a clear vision. But then I am not willing that education should aim at enlightening and producing angels with luminous wings. All I want is that "Education" should be dynamic as is development and impart practical lessons for its efficacy to cater and address the ongoing evolution. Only then can people talk about sustainable development. Well, I think they don't even have to talk about it because when education gives you wings and when all the existing socio-economic disparities ends, development will sustain on its own.<br>
                <img src="Images/consciousness2.jpg" alt="Image- Laughing Child">
                If humans can produce offspring's at their will, I believe they surely will fulfill my conscious dream and then this human caravan will surely be adorned. But the question is will it? If yes, then the forthcoming generations are sure to live a quality of life but if it is a no then the humans are quite smart&mdash; they know the consequences. <br><br>
                 Sydney J. Harris once said, "The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows". All my talks shall only become true when we realize Harris's statement to its true meaning. So this very moment when we realize that we are "unconscious" we will ironically be at the most conscious level and then we will be doing our best and mirrors will be turning into windows.<br><br> THANK YOU!
