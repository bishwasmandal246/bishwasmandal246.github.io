                <h2>Adaptive LSB substitution Steganography technique based on PVD</h2>
                <p>Abstract: Advancement in Internet technology has caused large text as well as multimedia data transfer over the Internet. To protect this data from unauthorized users, usage of security mechanisms like digital image steganography is highly essential. We have proposed a new steganography method deploying adaptive least significant bit (LSB) substitution and PVD. The gray scale image is partitioned in 3&#215;3 or 3&#215;3 plus 2&#215;2 pixel blocks. In a block one pixel is termed as reference pixel, where 4 LSB's are replaced. Thereafter, difference values between the central pixel and each neighbor pixel is calculated. Based on these difference values adaptive LSB substitution in the neighboring pixels is applied. This technique was proposed after discovering errors in Shukla et al.'s OPVD method. Experiments showed that the hiding capacity is 4.025 bpp with an acceptable PSNR value of 32.63 dB.  Furthermore, we ratified that the proposed method tolerates to RS analysis and PDH analysis.</p><p class="last-box">Status: Published &emsp; Publisher: IEEE<br><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8862579" target="_blank" class="publication-box">View Publication</a> </p>

                <h2>Perlustration on Mobile Forensics Tools</h2>
                <p>Abstract: Nowadays many people store more information in cellphones rather than do on their computer which leads to the increase of crimes taking place in mobile. This is also because of extensive use of mobile devices. People refer to store more information in mobile than in com- puter. Therefore, scope of forensics in mobile has increased in last few years as compared to computers. In this paper, we have carried out a survey on tools and techniques which are in practice for mobile forensics. The survey is the amalgamation of the in practice technical methods and discussion of some of the tools for specific operating systems. Some chal- lenges faced by practitioners while performing forensics has also been enlisted.</p><p class="last-box">Status: Accepted&emsp; <!-- <a href="#" class="publication-box">View Publication</a> --></p>

                <h2>Privacy Utility Trade-Off Problem</h2>
                <p>Abstract: Due to the recent popularity of online social networks, coupled with people's propensity to disclose personal information in an effort to achieve certain gratifications, the problem of navigating the tradeoff between privacy and utility attracted a lot of recent interest and generated a rich body of research. A critical prerequisite to solving the problem is to appropriately capture the privacy and the utility aspects in the problem formulation. Most of the existing works' focus is on the notion of privacy, while utility loss is often treated as the undesirable but necessary distortion of the true data, introduced by the privacy mechanism. By contrast, we are interested in modelling utility differently, by associating it with specific attributes of a user, just like privacy is associated with specific private attributes in the literature. Our model of utility facilitates a better and more precise privacy mechanism, and achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs. We further incorporate into our problem formulation a practical constraint on acceptable loss in utility per unit gain in privacy, which allows users to customize the privacy mechanisms in order to account for the relative values that each user associates with their own privacy and utility. This paper discusses the intricacies of our utility model and the corresponding privacy-utility tradeoff, and introduces a heuristic greedy algorithm to solve the problem..</p><p class="last-box">Status: Submitted&emsp; <!-- <a href="#" class="publication-box">View Publication</a> --></p>

                <p>Description: There are different kind of noises added in machine learning algorithms. Here we study the effects of noise on different machine learning and deep learning models. Additionally, we study the effects with different approaches of noise addition.</p><p class="last-box">Status: In Progress&emsp; <!-- <a href="#" class="publication-box">View Publication</a> --></p>
